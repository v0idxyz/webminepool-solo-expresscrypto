Script is VERY easy to use and even doesn't require database.
Simply unzip it and upload to your site. Then make some setup in config.json
Then set up cron job to run users.php once per minute

    "site_url"        - your site url
    "Commission"      - your profit from 1MH in satoshi. For exmample this is set to 20 and current webminepool rate is 125 - so you are paying 105sat to user and getting 20. 
    "minimal_payout"  - minimal amount of satoshi available to withdraw
    "referral" 	      - referral commission in %. 
    "manual_payouts"  - set this to 1 if you want to pay manually, and to 0 if you want to let users withdraw themselves. (1 is highly recommended) 
    
    "Fh_api_key"      - faucethub API key
    "wmp_site_key"    - webminepool public site key
    "wmp_private_key" - webminepool private key
    
    "admin_name"      - admin username
    "admin_pwd"       - admin password

    "miner_url"       - link to download YOUR preconfigured GUI miner (documentation here - https://webminepool.com/page/cli-mining)


To visit admin page (very basic) go to:
http://yoursite.com/admin?admin_name=admin&admin_pwd=admin

Note: CMD and Web mining services on the different servers and we are getting separate stats from them, so it's recommended to use separate webminepool accounts. We allow multiaccounting.

P.S. Use it at your own risk. Highly recommended to use this script just as a reference - example of what can be done via our HTTP API. This is fast written to show our API potential and doesn't follow coding best practices.
